Data Science Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)



Objective:

Apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and create insightful visualizations using at least two different programs (Python, R. Excel) to compare and contrut their effectiveness

-Data Cleaning: Address missing values, duplicates, and outliers etc.

-Exploration: Compute descriptive statistics, explore data distributions, and analyze correlations.


Visualisations:
-Visualization tools: Compare R and Python.
-Visualization Techniques: Create and compare visualizations suitable for EDA.

Comparison: Contrast how different tools handle data visualization and analysis.
